This bug occurs when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) in Objective-C.  The issue arises when an observed object is deallocated while observers are still registered. This leads to crashes or unexpected behavior because the observer attempts to access memory that has already been freed.  Specifically, consider the scenario where an object (A) observes another object (B) for changes in a certain property. If object B gets deallocated before object A removes its observation, the application will likely crash when the KVO mechanism attempts to notify the deallocated observer.
